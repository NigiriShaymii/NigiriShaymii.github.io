						<h2> Artist Statement </h2>

						<p> I am 21 years old, currently enrolling in San Jose State University with a major of "Concentration in Studio Practice". My dream career is to create games as a video game designer, working on lots of games that'll reflect creativity, story, and imagination. My philosophy is that to create a well designed game is to have four elements: visuals, music, mechanics, and story. Each element is crucial to bring out the entertainment and the engagement to the players and the audience in hopes of influencing and inspiring their creativity. <br> <br> There are incredible creators like Shigero Miyomoto, Steven Spielberg, Steve Jobs, and such who became inspired by the past and the present experience. People like them also have at least a formula to use as their guideline to make their products polished and perfected. I am still finding my own formula and my inspiration as a music composer and a digital artist in order to translate my skills and abilities to my games. <br> <br> My main objective is to improve and getting used to the art business so I can be determined and pressured (in a good way) to create my creations without rushing. I am concerned that we are losing what's important not just for our friends, families, and the business but ourselves as well. Even though reality can be confusing, nerve-wreaking, and pressurizing, I want to proceed my dream career so I can get comfortable with what I love and confidentally express my love for creating content packaged with visuals, interactions, and emotions. <br> <br> Thank you for taking your time to read this and I hope we can chat and negotiate if you want to commission me (coming soon...)!  </p>
