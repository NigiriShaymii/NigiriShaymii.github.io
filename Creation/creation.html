						<h3> Bring It On! </h3>
						<p> 2017, Digital Art
							<br><br>
							A mystical creature that bounds and breaks the fourth dimension.

							other computers.

						<h3> Glitched Arctic Wolf </h3>
						<p> 2018, Photoshop
							<br><br>
							Wolves are known for their almight power but sometimes there are lone wolves who are left
							to survive for themselves. By isoluation, their social behavior changes, corrupted and preventing
							peers to see the lone wolf's true form.

					<img src="../images/coast.jpg" alt="Coastal Geometry">
					<div class="bar">
						<h3> Coastal Geometry </h3>
						<p> 2018, Illustrator
							<br><br>
							As the pedestrians pass by the coast, the sky grew darker, casting the muted clouds throughout the land.
							Everything's lifeless and almost empty. Only humans scavenge what is left in the area.
							I feel the resonance of the soothing dystopia when I took a picture at that sidewalk. Reflecting the scene
							with vector art gives this haziness like a fog that blankets the memory like a translucent curtain.
						</p>

					<div class="bar">
						<h3> Pupperganda </h3>
						<p> 2018, Photoshop
							<br><br>
							A comedic image that focus on how the media became attracted to canines in general.
							While there is a big debate on whether cats or dogs claim the media by entertainment,
							dogs are more active and sought out because of their energy and vigorous play.

						<h3> Virtually Alike But Unique </h3>
						<p> 2020, JavaScript, p5.js, Interactive, Web-based
							<br><br>
							Even though users may feel they are related to another user and that they do not stand
							out from the crowd, <i>Virtually Alike But Unique </i> highlights the importance
							of becoming a part of something, regardless with a similar position or not, can
							make an individual unique to stand out.

						<h3> Saffron </h3>
						<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s3Sx2tui5iA"> Link to Youtube </a>
						<p> 2018, JavaScript, p5.js
							<br><br>
							By moving the mouse back and forth vertically and horizontally, the warm colored circles
							bloom and shrink. It reminds me of the dancing saffron pollens that float with the
							Middle Eastern gusts.

					<h2> Web Art and Interactives</h2>

					<div class="web">
						<h3> Roundabout Stars </h3>
						<a href="https://nigirishaymii.github.io/3D_Media/index.html"> Link to site </a>
						<p> 2018, JavaScript
							<br><br>
							I appropriate the star models and utilized them to turn and go into a circular motion. The
								fact that the universe is still in a questionable state tells me that there is still motion
								presented in that space physically and visually. It moves as the Earth moves and we are subjected
								to being part of it.

						<h3> Tom the Bunny </h3>
					</div>
					<div class="web">
						<a href="https://nigirishaymii.github.io/avatar/"> Link to Interactive Avatar </a>
						<p> 2020, JavaScript, p5.js, Interactive, Web-based
							<br><br>
							When have a presence in the virtual world and while there are some who show their real-selves
							to the internet, a majority uses avatars to characterize their online personality. For me,
							animals are more affectionate and relatable to our state of disbelief and our escapism.
							Tom the Bunny is a representation of who I am but also a different persona. I am interactable
							but I want to share my love and embrace acceptance without a hint of negativity.

						<h3> Combination Superpower </h3>
					</div>
					<div class="web">
						<a href="https://nigirishaymii.github.io/Art101_randomizor/"> Link to Interactive Randomizor </a>
						<p> 2020, JavaScript, p5.js, Interactive, Web-based
							<br><br>
							I like to ponder about human capabilities and how we can put them into use into
							our environment. What if we can memorize words with a look and bring them to life
							whenever wewant? How about cooking food in literally a second and for every entree created,
							a room in yourhouse will magically become cleaned? The childish curiosity and exploratory word
							play helpsenlighten what basic creativity and imagination can take us from any age.

						<h3> I Sense And Am Terrified, Self-Portrait </h3>
						<p> 2020, Digital Art
<br><br>
							Every time I look at myself in the mirror, I feel lost. It is like I am gazing
							at someone I should have been familiar with but something changed. My self-portrait
							reveals how I am robbed by society, manipulated to follow their rules that
							I am uncomfortable with. Creating this collage stirs discomfort and fear, seeing how
							much time passes in my life and how much I am manipulated and watched, physically and virtually.
