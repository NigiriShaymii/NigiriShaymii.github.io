						<h3> Bring It On! </h3>
						<p> 2017, Digital Art
							<br><br>
							A mystical creature that bounds and breaks the fourth dimension.

						<h3> What I Type Is What I Say </h3>
						<p> 2020, Digital Art
							<br>
							<br>
							Inspired by the Guerilla Girls' manifesto, <i>What I Type Is What I Say</i>
							explores with my freedom of expression through digital art. The braille is a code
							that can be encrypted and decrypted like the information that are data packaged and sent to
							other computers.

						<h3> Glitched Arctic Wolf </h3>
						<p> 2017, Photoshop
							<br><br>
							Wolves are known for their almight power but sometimes there are lone wolves who are left
							to survive for themselves. By isolation, their social behavior changes, corrupted and displacing
							their lone wolf's true form.

					<img src="../images/coast.jpg" alt="Coastal Geometry">
					<div class="bar">
						<h3> Coastal Geometry </h3>
						<p> 2017, Illustrator
							<br><br>
							As the pedestrians pass by the coast, the sky grew darker, casting the muted clouds throughout the land.
							Everything's lifeless and almost empty. Only humans scavenge what is left in the area.
							I feel the resonance of the soothing, cloudy shores when I took a picture at that sidewalk before using Illustrator.
							Reflecting the scene with vector art gives this haziness like a fog that blankets the memory like a translucent curtain.

					<div class="bar">
						<h3> Pupperganda </h3>
						<p> 2017, Photoshop
							<br><br>
							A comedic image that focus on the obsurdity and hyperactive attention to canines.
							While there is a big debate on whether cats or dogs claim the media by entertainment value,
							many people argue that dogs are more expressive and sought out because of their energy and vigorous play.
							I portray the humor and power of dogs as characters in a war-theme environment.

					<h2> Videos</h2>

					<div class="web">
						<h3> Live, Play, Explore </h3>
						<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxozJnPKD3E"> Link to Youtube</a>
						<p> 2017, 3:02 Minutes
							<br><br>
							Studies have shown that we tend to remember bad news and other negativities easier than
							the positives. Despite many coping their hardships with technology, habits, and other
							pleasurable activities, we forget to remember the small moments that build up to what we enjoy.
							I used Gustav Holst's music to add suspense to represent anxiety, complementing the tense tone
							with clips of war, conflicts, and over-the-top worldly issues. The second half of the video
							provides a light-hearted tone with my elevator-themed music composition. What I want to
							showcase is that there are little things to appreciate that are more valuable than thinking
							about various crisis 24/7.

						<h3> Saffron </h3>
						<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s3Sx2tui5iA"> Link to Youtube </a>
						<p> 2018, JavaScript, p5.js
							<br><br>
							By moving the mouse back and forth vertically and horizontally, the warm colored circles
							bloom and shrink. It reminds me of the dancing saffron pollens that float with the
							Middle Eastern gusts.

						<h3> Kaleidascope </h3>
						<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s3Sx2tui5iA"> Link to Vimeo </a>
						<p> 2020, Max8
							<br><br>
							This is a simple project that kickstart how I use Max8. <i>Kaleidascope</i>
							plays with color and the timing of the activated buttons.

						<h3> Ocean Tides for Percussion Duet </h3>
						<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s3Sx2tui5iA"> Link to Vimeo </a>
						<p> 2020, Max8
							<br><br>
							<i>Ocean Tides for Percussion Duet</i> describes my love for music and the sea,
							harmonizing the natural, wooden tone of the marimba and the metallic but
							soothing chimes of the vibraphone. The vibraphone and marimba both playing random, 'bright' notes
							and at different sound lengths and pitches. Two waves are depicted as low and high tide
							while the large blue square, the blue moon, initiates the songs of the crashing, soothing waves.

						<h3> Virtually Alike But Unique </h3>
						<p> 2020, JavaScript, p5.js, Interactive, Web-based
							<br><br>
							Even though users may feel they are related to another user and that they do not stand
							out from the crowd, <i>Virtually Alike But Unique </i> highlights the juxtaposition between
							being a part of something and being an individual. Contrasting one's identity and their role
							in society are important to work out their advantages and disadvantages.
							However, I argue that embracing both alikes and differences make a person unique.
							Virtually, it works similar but in a different system.

						<h3> Roundabout Stars </h3>
						<a href="https://nigirishaymii.github.io/3D_Media/index.html"> Link to site </a>
						<p> 2017, JavaScript
							<br><br>
							I appropriate the star models and utilized them to turn and go into a circular motion. The
							fact that the universe is still in a questionable state tells me that there is still motion
							presented in that space physically and visually. It moves as the Earth moves and we are subjected
							to being part of it.

						<h3> Tom the Bunny </h3>

					<div class="web">
						<a href="https://nigirishaymii.github.io/avatar/"> Link to Interactive Avatar </a>
						<p> 2020, JavaScript, p5.js, Interactive, Web-based
							<br><br>
							When have a presence in the virtual world and while there are some who show their real-selves
							to the internet, a majority uses avatars to characterize their online personality. For me,
							animals are more affectionate and relatable to our state of disbelief and our escapism.
							Tom the Bunny is a representation of who I am but also a different persona. I am interactable
							but I want to share my love and embrace acceptance without a hint of negativity.

						<h3> Combination Superpower </h3>

						<a href="https://nigirishaymii.github.io/Art101_randomizor/"> Link to Interactive Randomizor </a>
						<p> 2020, JavaScript, p5.js, Interactive, Web-based
							<br><br>
							I like to ponder about human capabilities and how we can put them into use into
							our environment. What if we can memorize words with a look and bring them to life
							whenever wewant? How about cooking food in literally a second and for every entree created,
							a room in yourhouse will magically become cleaned? The childish curiosity and exploratory word
							play helpsenlighten what basic creativity and imagination can take us from any age.

						<h3> I Sense And Am Terrified, Self-Portrait </h3>
						<p> 2020, Digital Art
							<br><br>
							Every time I look at myself in the mirror, I feel lost. It is like I am gazing
							at someone I should have been familiar with but something changed. My self-portrait
							reveals how I am robbed by society, manipulated to follow their rules that
							I am uncomfortable with. When I created this collage, it stirs discomfort and fear, seeing how
							much time passes in my life and how much I am manipulated and watched, physically and virtually.
							I became speechless but my chest wants to scream my thoughts. For that, I am mentally shattered
							but whether I can recover is plausible.

						<h3> Who Am I? </h3>
						<p> 2019, Waxed Paper, Colored Pencil, 1' x 1'5"
							<br><br>
							Inspired by De Kooning, <i>Who Am I</i> is another self portrait
							with erased pictures that resembles my hobbies, passion, and a slight hint of Korean culture.
							However, our lives has been transformed by the world around us. We are exposed to education,
							trendings, money, and trust issues that slowly dissolve what we yearn for ourselves.
							For me, dreams and goals are distorted and fading, sacrificing our career for the things
							we are unsatisfied but essential to thrive.

						<h3> Mobius Mollusk </h3>
						<p> 2019, Hanging Ornament, Watercolor Paper, Pen, Sea Shells, Micro-USB and Apple duo connector,
							4" x 4" x 5"
							<br><br>
							Hundreds and thousands of newborns exist in the world, filled with
							potential that they hope they become worthy to their civilization. As they hit adulthood,
							their opportunities are being gambled by society and only a small portion
							are able to succeed for their careers, dreams, and jobs. The rest continue to
							develop their skills and talents and wait for their next opportunity to arrive.
							The cycle of self-expression starts to transform into a twisted loop, becoming
							one-way as people sacrifice their personal space to desperately devote themselves
							to business.

						<h3> Untitled Title </h3>
						<p> 2019, White Wooden Panel, Printer Paper, Watercolor, Blood, Coffee, Magazine,
							Colored Pencil, Pen, Marker, 1'4" x 1'2" x 1"
							<br><br>
							Over 7.8 billion humans live in on Earth and a majority of them are creators,
							artists, and performers. A small portion of those creators are recognized for their
							genius and creativity while the others are left striving for hoping their crafts
							and work become a success in their lives. My piece is a love letter to the forgotten
							or unrecognized artists who struggled hardships and trauma, unwilling and unfortunate
							to show their art to their audience.
